# Natural_Gas_Production
In this example, we will try to adopt a pure data-based approach to forecast Canada’s natural gas production using Facebook’s Prophet library. 
The idea of this post is to use a univariate time-series dataset and produce a best-fit model that allows us to confidently predict future production. 
We will be using the model to forecast the production for the next 10 years i.e. until 2030.
